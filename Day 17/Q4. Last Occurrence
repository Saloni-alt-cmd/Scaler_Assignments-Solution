Problem Description

You are given a character string A, having length N and an integer ASCII code B.

You have to tell the rightmost occurrence of the character having ASCII code equal to B, in A or report that it does not exist.
Letter ASCII 
a	     097	
b	     098	
c	     099	
d	    100	
e	    101	
f	    102	
g	    103	
h	    104	
i	    105
j	    106	
k	    107

Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 105

A[i] âˆˆ ['a'-'z']

97 <= B <= 122



Input Format

First argument is a character string A.

Second argument is an integer B.



Output Format

If there exists an occurrence, return the rightmost index(0 - based), else return -1.



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = "aabbcc"
 B = 98 
Input 2:

 A = "abc"
 B = 100


Example Output

Output 1:

 3 
Output 2:

 -1 


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Character having ASCII code equal to 98 = 'b' 
 Rightmost index of character 'b' in "aabbcc" is 3.
Explanation 2:

 Character having ASCII code equal to 100 = 'd'
 Character 'd' is not present in "abc".
