Problem Description

Write a program to input from user three numbers(A, B & C) representing side lengths of a triangle.

You have to print if the traingle is "equilateral", "scalene" or "isosceles".



Problem Constraints

1 <= A <= 100000

1 <= B <= 100000

1 <= C <= 100000



Input Format

One line containing three space separated integers A, B & C.



Output Format

One string either "equilateral", "scalene" or "isosceles".



Example Input

Input 1:

5 6 7
Input 2:

30 30 30


Example Output

Output 1:

scalene
Output 2:

equilateral


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

Since all sides are different, hence it's a scalene triangle.
Explanation 2:

Since all sides are same, hence it's a equilateral triangle.
