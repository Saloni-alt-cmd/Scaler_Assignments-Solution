Problem Description
Write a program to input an integer T which represents the number of test cases. For each test case input two integers A and B in two different lines. For each pair of A and B print the HCF of the given two numbers.


Problem Constraints
1 <= T <= 1000

1 <= A,B <= 1000000



Input Format
The first line of input contains T which means number of test cases.

Next 2T lines contains input A and B for each testcase.
First line of each testcase contain an integer A and second line of the testcase contains input B.



Output Format
T lines each containing an integer representing HCF of A & B.
